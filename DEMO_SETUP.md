# Development Authentication Setup

## Current Setup

The application now uses a clean mock authentication system ready for real user registration and login.

### 🚀 **How to Test**

1. **Visit the Application**: Navigate to `http://localhost:3000`
2. **Create Account**: Use the signup form to register a new account
3. **Login**: Use your registered email and password to sign in
4. **Development Password**: For development, any registered user can login with password `password123`

### ✨ **What You Can Test**

- ✅ **Real Registration Flow**: Create accounts with any email/name
- ✅ **Authentication Flow**: Login/logout functionality  
- ✅ **Route Protection**: Unauthenticated users redirected to login
- ✅ **User Profile**: See user info in header dropdown
- ✅ **Mantra Tracking**: Full app functionality once logged in
- ✅ **Visual Feedback**: Green progress bars and checkmarks
- ✅ **Responsive Design**: Works on mobile and desktop
- ✅ **Dark/Light Theme**: Toggle between themes

### 🔧 **Technical Details**

- **Mock Service**: Located in `/src/lib/mock-auth.ts`
- **User Storage**: Dynamic user registration (simulates database)
- **Local Storage**: User data persists until logout
- **Development Mode**: Uses simplified password validation
- **No Backend Required**: Fully functional without API server
- **Ready for Migration**: Easy to replace with real API calls

### 🎨 **UI Features to Test**

1. **Registration**: Create new accounts with custom names
2. **Homepage**: Mantra management, stats, quick actions
